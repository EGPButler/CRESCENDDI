# CRESCENDDI: A Clinically-relevant REference Set CENtered around Drug-Drug Interactions

This repository contains code used for generating CRESCENDDI (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.5481408), a reference set aimed to facilitate research in postmarketing surveillance related to drug-drug interactions. It includes scripts for data extraction, concept normalisation, generation of positive and negative controls, and application of signal detection algorithms to screen spontaneous reporting system databases.
